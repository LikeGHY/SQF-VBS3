## Usage

### Snippets
- As you type out a command that has a snippet created for it, you will see it as an autocomplete option. 
- If you hit `Enter` with the snippet option highlighted, the rest of the code will be filled in.
- Once the code has been added, you can hit `Tab` to move to each of the key input areas for that command/code block
